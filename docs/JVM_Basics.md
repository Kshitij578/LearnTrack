What is JDK, JRE, JVM

JDK – Java Development Kit
Use: To create Java programs
Think of JDK as a toolbox for Java developers.
It includes:
Tools to write Java code
A compiler (javac) to convert code into bytecode
Everything needed to develop and run Java programs
If you want to write Java code, you need JDK.
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JDK → Write + Run Java programs
JDK → Kitchen with cooking tools (to cook food)

JRE – Java Runtime Environment
Use: To run Java programs
Think of JRE as a player that can run Java programs.
It includes:
JVM
Java libraries required for execution
 If you only want to run a Java program (not write one), JRE is enough.
JRE = JVM + Libraries
JRE → Run Java programs
JRE → Dining table (to eat food)
JVM – Java Virtual Machine
Use: To execute Java programs
Think of JVM as the engine.
What it does:
Reads Java bytecode (.class file)
Converts it into machine-specific instructions
Runs the program on your system
JVM makes Java platform-independent.
JVM = Runs the program
JVM → Executes Java bytecode
JVM → Person who eats the food

What is bytecode

Bytecode is platform-independent code generated by a Java compiler that is executed by the JVM.
How Bytecode is Created
You write Java code → HelloWorld.java
Java compiler (javac) converts it into → HelloWorld.class
This .class file contains bytecode
Why Bytecode is Used
It is not machine-specific
It can run on any system that has a JVM
JVM converts bytecode into machine code for the system

What does “write once, run anywhere” mean (1–2 short paragraphs)

Write once, run anywhere” means that a Java program is written and compiled one time, and the same compiled program can run on different operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS without changing the code.

This is possible because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is platform-independent. Each operating system has its own JVM, and the JVM converts the same bytecode into machine-specific instructions. As long as a system has a JVM, the Java program will run the same way everywhere.
